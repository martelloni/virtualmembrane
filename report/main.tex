\section{Introduction}

A specific class of digital musical instruments, or DMI, aims to
decouple the human playing interaction and the physical response
of the acoustic body. The instrument is thereby seen as a mute
controller interface to a digital sound-producing device.
This design paradigm allows the control of virtual instruments
based on physical models. It might be seen as bizarre to choose to
cut off the physics of an instrument, only to then try and
reproduce them as accurately as the technology allows. However,
the designer can then alter or augment the physics of the
instrument arbitrarily; for example, they could map a drum
or a set of percussions onto a guitar's body.

The work presented in this report aims to cover the first steps
in the design of such an instrument. We are going to try and
run a virtual vibrating membrane on Bela, and control it with
the signal coming from one axis of an accelerometer.

The major challenge of this task is to
ensure a correct implementation of the membrane's equations,
a requirement that can prove very tricky when programming on
an embedded target as a black box. Therefore, most of our analysis
will be performed in simulation on standard C++ code; on-target
evaluation will be the last step, a rather ambitious moment
of truth at the end of the development efforts.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Prior Work}

The numerical reproduction of percussion instruments has been
extensively studied, all the way to advanced techniques
modelling the non-linearities of such systems. Good surveys of
all available techniques come from the works by
Rossing \emph{et al.} \cite{rossing2004acoustics},
Bilbao \cite{bilbao2009modular}
and Mehes \emph{et al} \cite{mehes2017virtual}.

Implementations of purely linear model are both less computationally
intensive and easier to understand and implement. Two methods
seem to have been quite successful in reproducing membranes in
real time and are featured in working implementations of musical
instruments: the Digital Waveguide model by Fontana and Rocchesso
\cite{fontana1998physical} and the Transfer Function methods
analysed in Trautmann \emph{et al.} \cite{trautmann2001physical}.

The two-dimensional Digital Waveguide model is a well-established
model that extends the principle of the Digital Waveguide,
widely used to model tubes such as wind instruments, to a vibrating
surface.
The article referenced above provides a clear breakdown
of all the continuous-time and discrete-time physics involved,
and it provides solutions to problems such as mesh stability,
mesh excitation, energy attenuation and modelling of air loading
for a more accurate real-world drum reproduction.
Thererfore, we chose to base the implementation of our project upon
the Digital Waveguide method.

A reference implementation of a Digital Waveguide mesh is already
available in an early version
(0.62)\footnote{\url{http://www.soundobject.org/SDT/downloads/SDT_src-062.zip}}
of the Sound Design Toolkit \cite{baldan2017sound}.
The topology of the mesh available in the toolkit is rectilinear;
however the authors describe how using a triangular mesh
optimises the dispersion error for most geometries, and especially
for the circular membranes of drums \cite{fontana1998physical}.
We will implement a triangular mesh
from first principles following this
suggestion. 

\subsection{Theory}

% Outline sources
The following summary of the theory behind digital waveguides in
a triangular mesh structure is based on \cite{fontana1998physical};
some ideas and concepts are taken from the implementation of
triangular membranes for room acoustics in \cite{murphy2000digital}.
A more complete review of the whole process applied to virtual drums
can also be found in \cite{laird2001physical}.

% Waveguide basics
\paragraph{Waveguide basics.}
The principle of the one-dimensional waveguide comes from the well-known
D'Alembert solution of the
wave wave equation for the transverse velocity \(v(t, x)\),
indicating two velocity waves travelling in opposite
directions:

\begin{equation}
v(t, x) = v_{+}(x - ct) + v_{-}(x + ct)
\end{equation}\label{eq:dalembert}

We can assume that waves propagate following the equation above
in ideal strings. When a number \(N\) of
identical strings is joined
together, we can write an equation for the transmission and
scattering of the waves among those strings at their junction
point \(i\):

\begin{equation}
v_{i-}(t) = \frac{2}{N}\,\sum_{k=1}^{N}v_{k+}(t)-v_{i+}(t)
\end{equation}\label{eq:losslessj}

\(v_{i-}\) being the outgoing wave from the junction, as a
function of the incoming waves \(v_{k+}\) from the strings
joined together.

Both equations can be discretised by sampling the space
into \(\Delta s\) spatial samples and time as \(t = nT\)
periods:

\begin{equation}
    v(nT, x) = v_{+}(x - cnT) + v_{-}(x + cnT)
\end{equation}\label{eq:discretewave}
\begin{equation}
    v_{i-}(nT) = \frac{2}{N}\,\sum_{k=1}^{N}v_{k+}(nT)-v_{i+}(nT)
\end{equation}\label{eq:discretelosslessj}

We are going to assume that the mesh is perfectly homogeneous
(no difference in impedance in the interfaces) and the boundaries
are perfectly rigid, that is, the wave is fully reflected back
(\(r = 1\))
and any point beyond the boundary will have (\(v = 0\)).

% Triangular mesh equations

\paragraph{Triangular mesh.}

Joining six waveguides we have a structure that can effectively
sample a two-dimensional space along directions \(x\),
\(l = \frac{1}{2} x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y\) and
\(m = \frac{1}{2} x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y\). Figure
\ref{fig:coord} depicts this structure and the related coordinates.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig/fontanamesh}
    \caption{Triangular mesh coordinates \cite{fontana1998physical}.}\label{fig:coord}
\end{figure}

We can then rewrite equation \ref{eq:discretelosslessj} in two
parts and restrict the number of waveguides to a maximum of 6,
assuming impedance is either homogeneous or infinite (no transmission).
We can then divide the computation into a \emph{scattering equation}
and a \emph{junction output} (after \cite{murphy2000digital}):

\begin{equation}
    v_{i}(nT) = \frac{2}{N}\,\sum_{k=1}^{N}v_{k+}(nT)
\end{equation}\label{eq:scatter}

\begin{equation}
    v_{k-}(nT) = v_{i}(nT) - v_{k+}(nT) \,\,\,\,\, \mbox{for}\, k = {1 \dots N}
\end{equation}\label{eq:output}

Junctions having fewer than six waveguides will just ignore
the directions that aren't connected to another junction point.
A good convention to enumerate the coordinates of the junction
points comes from \cite{murphy2000digital}. We will count clockwise
from the first point at top-right: North-East, East, South-East,
South-West, West and North-West.

% Courant condition

\paragraph{Constraints.}
The digital waveguide method imposes a relationship between spatial
and temporal sampling. When designing the mesh or even running
an offline simulation, one can leave the speed of the medium
\(c\) unspecified. However, in a real-time system, the temporal
sampling period \(T\) is defined by the system, and so must be the
medium speed. The stability of the mesh is enforced by the
Courant condition, which in this case takes the following
form \cite{fontana1998physical}:

\begin{equation}
\Delta x = \Delta l = \Delta m = \sqrt{2}cT
\end{equation}\label{eq:courant}

% Absorption, air loading

\paragraph{Absorption, air loading, excitation.}
The sources referenced provide a good breakdown of all the more
advanced problems around lossy junctions, air loading in
a cylindrical drum as a spring-mass model, excitation models.
We will limit ourselves to the simplest case of a lossless
stable membrane, excited directly with an arbitrary audio signal
\(y(nT)\), using the excitation model outlined
in \cite{murphy2000digital}. The source signal is injected as incoming
waves into a designated junction:

\begin{equation}
    v_{k+}(nT) = \frac{y(nT)}{2}
\end{equation}\label{eq:inject}
